**Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on pharmaceutical industry data. The goal is to uncover insights about market trends, top manufacturers, product discontinuation patterns, and company-wise product stability.

Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, this project highlights how pharmaceutical companies manage product lifecycles, adapt to competition, and align with regulatory demands.

**Dataset**

Rows:2,53,973

Columns: 9

Features include: Manufacturer, Product Name, Status (Active/Discontinued), etc.

**Key Objectives**

Analyze the distribution of products across manufacturers.

Identify top-performing pharma companies.

Study discontinued product trends.

Compare stable vs. dynamic product portfolios.

Provide insights for business and market strategies.

**Tools & Libraries**

Python 

Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

NumPy – Numerical operations

**Key Insights**

Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Abbott dominate the market in terms of product share.

These top players also report higher discontinuation rates, indicating continuous portfolio restructuring.

Companies like Ajanta Pharma and Ipca Laboratories maintain stable product lines with fewer discontinuations.

Discontinuations often signal market adaptation and innovation, not just product failure.

**Conclusion**

The EDA reveals that long-term success in pharma requires both stability and adaptability. Companies balancing steady product lines while embracing innovation through discontinuations are better positioned for sustainable growth.
